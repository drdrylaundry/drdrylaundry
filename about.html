      <h2>🧼 About Dr. Dry</h2>
      <h3>From Corporate Desks to Clean Dreams</h3>
      <p>Every brand has a beginning.<br>
      Ours began behind office desks—working long hours in the corporate world, carrying a silent desire to do something of our own. Coming from humble backgrounds, we didn’t have the luxury or privilege to start big. But we had the will, and that was enough.<br>
      We, <strong>Ashish Nagrale</strong> and <strong>Rinku Nagrale</strong>, started small—our first step into entrepreneurship was not flashy. We began with a franchise model, learning every detail from scratch. One store turned into two. Two became four. And over five years, we quietly built something with our own hands—not just a business, but a dream.<br>
      During these years, we worked on the ground—understanding customers, managing daily operations, handling garments, dealing with stains, and more. We didn’t just run a laundry—we lived it.<br>
      That’s when we realized: it was time for something bigger.<br>
      It was time to build our own brand.</p>
      <h3>🌿 The Birth of Dr. Dry</h3>
      <p><strong>Dr. Dry</strong> isn’t just a laundry and dry-cleaning service.<br>
      It’s a brand born out of ground-level experience, crafted by people who know the ins and outs of this industry.<br>
      We specialize in dry cleaning with <strong>99% stain removal efficiency</strong>, especially for garments where customers have lost hope. Our goal isn’t just to clean—it’s to restore, to care, and to build trust.<br>
      We blend modern technology with traditional fabric care, ensuring every item we touch is treated with precision, gentleness, and respect.</p>
